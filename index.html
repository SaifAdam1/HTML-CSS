    <p style="font-size: 18px;">People often associate depression with past trauma or some heinous event in one’s life that led them to become a victim of depression. But is that right? Is it really only scary<br /> events that cause depression? And do people with depression all want to wear black all the time, never talk to anyone, and only think of ending their lives? These opinions are<br /> nothing but general stereotypes that don't even represent 3% of cases of depression.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Depression doesn’t necessarily require a past trauma or event to affect someone. It varies significantly from person to person. Someone can suffer from depression for various<br /> reasons, from a broken relationship to witnessing or experiencing a horrific event, such as what is currently happening to Palestinians.</p>
